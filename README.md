# A Brief Go Intro
This is an introduction to Go with code examples. Core programming concepts will not be covered or exemplified; they will be assumed. The intended audience are those who are transitioning from another language to Go, especially higher-level level languages (i.e., JavaScript or Python), functional languages (Elixir), or OOP languages (C#, Java). 

Writing basic scripts in Go is not challenging. A cursory knowledge of syntax and the standard library goes a long way. The most common difficulties that I've been asked to explain typically relate to _idiom_ and _memory_. __Idiom__ refers to those uniquenesses of Go that make it Go. Anyone can bring the coventions of one language to another and make it work (with limations; Go has no Classes, so you can't bring traditional OOP to Go with any success). But the Go community has long-established standars for what is considered good Go and what does not. This runs as deep as the directory structure of your project, how external dependencies are managed, and how to write comments. __Memory__ can be a diffucult topic for folks with experience in languages where memory management and use is inconsequential, typically interpreted languages. The main challenge in Go is usually when to use a pointer and when not to. But more advanced memory management gives strong consideration to the data objects and relationships and how to best leverage the system for your application.

This leads to a third challenge many will face: _types_.
